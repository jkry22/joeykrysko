                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;"> Currently, I am a second-year biomedical engineering student at Penn State University. I have always been passionate about all branches of math and science so engineering felt like an obvious choice. After graduation, I hope to find a position in medical research or drug manufacturing because I believe that the medical industry has a lot of room to improve. I hope that in this industry I can help create cheaper and more effective treatments.</p>
    
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">In my freetime, I love watching Philly and PSU sports teams. I have been going to Penn State Football games in Beaver Stadium since I was 8, and I am still amazed by the atmosphere in the stadium every time I go to a game. I also like to play guitar. I have been playing on and off for a few years, and even though I am not amazing at it, I still have a lot of fun playing.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Goodwill Keystone sponsored a design challenge for my engineering design class. Students in every section attempted to solve one of Goodwill's main problems. My group decided to improve upon Goodwill's current Z-rack design by making it more spacially efficient. We also attempted to imporve worker efficiency in stores by creating a transfer rack that doubles as a display rack. This system allows employees to save time by allowing them to restock the store by simply swapping out the racks instead of hanging each individual article of clothing. </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">At the Penn State Engineering Expo we presented our design to engineering professors and Goodwill Keystone Representatives, and we placed as finalists in the design challenge. </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Within the group, I was primarily in charge of creating models of the new rack design using Solidworks. The images to the right show how the racks can be packed efficiently in warehouses and shipping trucks. The models also show how our rack doubles as a display rack. They can be linked together to form traditional store isles with space to hang clothing on both sides.</p>
